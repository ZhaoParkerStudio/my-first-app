# My First App

Welcome to your first web project! Here is a breakdown of what each file does:

## 1. Structure: `index.html`
Think of this as the skeleton of your website. It defines the content, like the button and the text.
- `<h1>`: The main heading.
- `<button>`: The clickable button.
- `<div class="container">`: A box to hold everything together.

## 2. Style: `style.css`
This is the makeup and clothing for your skeleton. It makes the site look good.
- `body { ... }`: Sets the background color and centers everything.
- `.container { ... }`: Styles the white box.
- `button:hover { ... }`: Changes the button color when you hover over it.

## 3. Logic: `script.js`
This is the brain. It makes the page interactive.
- It listens for a "click" on the button.
- When clicked, it picks a random color from a list.
- It updates the background color and the text.
